# Sample code
Some tutorials come with sample code for a more hands-on learning experience.
The following sample programs are available:

| Tutorial |Â Sample Program |
| -: | - |
| 01 | Simple program that reads a file and writes the image to another|
| 02 | Program that optimizes the contrast of a grayscale image|
| 03 | Program that colorizes a grayscale image using pseudocolors|
| 04 | Program that applies a motion blur effect to an image using a linear filter|
| 05 | Program that loads a Matlab file to showcase algebra functions|

# Sample images for sample code
NICE-core supports PPM and PGM images out of the box without any additional
dependencies.

See the __samples__ folder for sample images that work with the sample code
from the tutorials.

## Grayscale sample images
The grayscale samples are 8-bit PGM files.
You can use them with the following sample programs:

* Tutorial 02
* Tutorial 03
* Tutorial 04

## Color sample images
The color samples are 8-bit-per-channel PPM images.
They work with the sample code from these tutorials:

* Tutorial 01

# Other samples
We also include some Matlab files for use with the following samples:

* Tutorial 05
* Tutorial 06
